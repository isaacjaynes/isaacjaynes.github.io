Hello! I'm Isaac Macpherson Jaynes, a math enthusiast, language lover, and a global citizen with a diverse background. Born on April 29th, 1999, in Boise, Idaho, my life has been a mosaic of experiences, cultures, and passions.

At 10 years old, my family and I moved to Marina, California, broadening my horizons and offering new opportunities. Four years later, we ventured to Heubach, Hesse, Germany, where I immersed myself in the language and culture, mastering German through an accelerated program at the Goetheschule in Dieburg. Academically, I achieved one of the top grades of my class on my Abitur at the Landrat Gruber Schule in Dieburg.

Feeling a pull towards my roots, I returned to Boise to study Computer Science at Boise State University. After a year, I realized I needed a more challenging environment, and that led me to the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. In April 2023, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. I remain in Vancouver to this day, as I have come to hold the friends I have made over the years dearly.

Throughout my journey, I've discovered a love for hands-on work, which has led me to explore electronics, mechanics, and computers. My hobbies reflect my adventurous spirit, including mountain biking, rock climbing, weightlifting, and seeking new adventures. But I also appreciate the simple pleasures of life, like relaxing at home.

My eclectic work experience includes positions at an industrial production line (Frenger), as an auto mechanic (Autohaus Brass), the European Space Agency (EUMETSAT), a chemical research institution (Merck), mobile app development (Mersive), and ground-up system design for a tech startup (Tis The Season). Currently, I'm working for a cybersecurity company in the Cloud Protection & Licensing devision (Thales CPL), bringing my diverse skill set to new challenges.

My identity is a blend of experiences and cultures from the US, Germany, and Canada. When asked where I'm from, I cherish the unique combination that makes me who I am today.
