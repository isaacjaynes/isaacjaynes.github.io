I was born in Boise, Idaho, USA on April 29th 1999. I have Canadian citizenship through my father, who is half-canadian, as his mother is Canadian.

I moved with my dad, step mother, and sister to Marina, California, USA when I was 10 years old.

I moved with them again to Heubach, Hesse, Germany when I was 14. I learned German in an accelerated program at the Goetheschule in Dieburg.
I graduated with a 1.7 average Abitur at the Landrat Gruber Schule in Dieburg. 

After recieving my Abitur, I moved back to Boise to live with my mother and studied Computer Science as Boise State University. After one year there, I decided that I needed mire room to grow, since BSU was too easy, so I applied and got into the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, Canada. I will graduate with a Bachelour of Science in Mathematics in April 2023.

Whenever anyone asks me where I am from, I never know exactly what to say, since I feel I am from many different places, be it the US, Germany, or Canada.
